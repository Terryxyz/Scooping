# Scooping
## 1. Overview
A novel dexterous robotic manipulation technique which we called Scooping is implemented by this package. The work implies autonoumus picking of thin profile objects from the flat surface and in a dense clutter environment, plastic cards, domino blocks, Go stones for example, using two-finger parallel jaw gripper having one length-controllable digit. The technique presents the ability to carry out complete bin picking: from the first to the last one. The package includes gripper design used, pre-scoop planning, object detection and instance segmentation by Mask-RCNN, scoop-grasp manipulation package and collision check.

## 2. Prerequisites
### 2.1 Hardware
- [**Universal Robot UR10**](https://www.universal-robots.com/products/ur10-robot/)
- [**Robotiq 140mm Adaptive parallel-jaw gripper**](https://robotiq.com/products/2f85-140-adaptive-robot-gripper)
- [**RealSense Camera SR300**](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/realsense-ros)
- [**Customized Gripper design**](https://github.com/HKUST-RML/scooping/tree/master/Gripper%20design) comprises a variable-length thumb and a dual-material finger, for realizing finger length difference during scooping and dual material fingertip for the combination of dig-grasping and scooping.
<!-- - [**Customized Finger design**](https://github.com/HKUST-RML/dig-grasping/tree/master/fingertip%20design) features fingertip concavity---
- [**Extendable Finger**](https://github.com/HKUST-RML/extendable_finger) for realizing finger length differences during digging -->


### 2.2 Software
This implementation requires the following dependencies (tested on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS):
- [**ROS Kinetic**](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Installation)
- [**Urx**](https://github.com/SintefManufacturing/python-urx) for UR10 robot control
- [**robotiq_2finger_grippers**](https://github.com/chjohnkim/robotiq_2finger_grippers.git): ROS driver for Robotiq Adaptive Grippers
- [**Mask R-CNN**](https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN) for instance segmentation (also see the dependencies therein).
<!-- - [**Mask R-CNN**](https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN) for instance segmentation (also see the dependencies therein). Also download the trained weights for [Go stone](https://hkustconnect-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/ztong_connect_ust_hk/Eb7z0WBHf8BOgLfkGKQf1wsBcZgVAwpUTJP7Q9u0y8h5Kw?e=15cEsA) and [capsule](https://hkustconnect-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/yhngad_connect_ust_hk/EY5C4hAOm-xNoQ1oHyhArtgBe91wuVaWSf3N2D1fJmcERg?e=aHRnJa).-->
- [**OpenCV 3.4.1**](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/3.4.1.15/) and [**Open3D 0.7.0.0**](http://www.open3d.org/docs/0.7.0/getting_started.html)
- [**PyBullet**](https://pybullet.org/wordpress/) for collision check

**Note**: The online compiler [**Jupyter Notebook**](https://jupyter.org/) is needed to run our program.

## 3. Pre-scoop Planning
We have developed a pre-scoop planner in [python](https://www.python.org/) to get the appropriate fingertip locations on the object face for successful scooping process.

</p>

To get the plan of Go stone, domino, triangular prism, run the following program respectively:

`Scooping/Pre-Scoop Planning/Go_stone.py`

`Scooping/Pre-Scoop Planning/domino.py`

`Scooping/Pre-Scoop Planning/triangular.py`

## 3. Real Experiments to Practice Scooping
### 3.1 Build on ROS
In your [catkin workspace](http://wiki.ros.org/catkin/Tutorials/create_a_workspace):
```
cd ~/catkin_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/HKUST-RML/Scooping.git
cd ..
catkin_make
source devel/setup.bash
```
Activate the force/torque sensor, robotiq 2-fingered gripper and RealSense Camera in three separate terminals:
```
roslaunch robotiq_ft_sensor gripper_sensor.launch   
roslaunch robotiq_2f_gripper_control robotiq_action_server.launch comport:=/dev/ttyUSB0 stroke:=0.140        
roslaunch realsense2_camera rs_camera.launch align_depth:=true
```
